<h1> Chase No Face </h1> 
  
   <p> Chase No Face by BELL, is a music video that utilizes face mapping. This project was made possible by Zach Lieberman, Francisco Zamorano, Andy Wallace, and Michelle Calabro in 2011. Facial mapping is a branch of projection mapping, which detects a subjects face and uses the face as a canvas for projections that alter or add shapes to allude to a larger picture. 
In this project, Lieberman, Zamorano, and Wallace projected the colors blue and pink transitioning into each other with red dots detecting her facial features, followed by two green lines that move further away from the center of her face with the beat, then by a denser network of red dots. Another image that dominated the video is a white eye mask with lines coming up and down from her eyes. Alternating images using green, pink and orange follow. Images of pink cheeks and green eyebrows , then converting to pink lines with pink wine bottle shapes framing her jaws up to her forehead. The lines seem to become larger, following a flame-like behavior when she reaches a louder part of the song. There is a scene in which bright dots appear, the behavior of the dots are scattered amongst her face and realigns to provide support to her natural structure when she sings using the vowel ‘o’. 






The specifics of producing this project include a process of fitting preset images into a 3D modeling software like Rhino, Fusion, or Autocad, then scaling the drawing to a picture of the scene that will be projected onto. Projectors for projection mapping vary in size and price range depending on the specific project, for the ‘Chase No Face’ music video, it is to be assumed that a smaller scale projector was used as the projections are confined to only her face. 
 The process of projecting onto a moving object progresses in complexity. A camera is introduced to the project and is calibrated with a computer to receive data, the computer then matches the frames to the “subject”, and outputs a signal to projecting specifically to the frames that take up the predetermined subject role. There comes issues with using a moving subject since the pipeline of data between the camera, computer, and projector are slow, therefore it is not possible to map high speed movements of subjects to projections. To pinpoint the direct placement of a desired projection, rather than looking at the general shape of an object and fine tuning, the calibration is set by using a distinct placement of an object, such as a beacon or edge. As for face capture, it is difficult since there is no hard edge, For the ‘Chase No Face’ video, it is to be assumed that the designers used her nose in proximity to her eyes, in some of the scenes there are visible delays as mentioned previously in regards to movement of her face. Although the delay has the possibility to hinder a performance, the particle delay works for this specific project due to the song being slow tempo, and steady. The delay provides a feeling of lightness, almost as if she were floating in air. 

In summary, “Chase No Face” utilizes facial projection mapping, out of many ways of using projection mapping to luminate and enhance the musician, BELL’s performance. The practice is not perfect, due to delays in the streamline of data between the camera and computer, but it enhances the video by providing to the mood of the song.
